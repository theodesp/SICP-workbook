; Exercise 2.2Define a constructor make-segment and selectors
; start-segment and end-segment that define the representation
; of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be
; represented as a pair of numbers: the xx coordinate and the yy
; coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and
; selectors x-point and y-point that define this representation.
; Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a procedure
; midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as argument and returns
; its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the
;                   coordinates of the endpoints).
