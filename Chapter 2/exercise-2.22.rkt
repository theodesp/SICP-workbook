;Exercise 2.22: Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first square-list procedure of Exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:
;
;(define (square-list items)
;  (define (iter things answer)
;    (if (null? things)
;        answer
;        (iter (cdr things)
;              (cons (square (car things))
;                    answer))))
;  (iter items nil))
;Unfortunately, defining square-list this way produces the answer list in the reverse order of the one desired. Why?
;
;Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to cons:
;
;(define (square-list items)
;  (define (iter things answer)
;    (if (null? things)
;        answer
;        (iter (cdr things)
;              (cons answer
;                    (square 
;                     (car things))))))
;  (iter items nil))
;This doesnâ€™t work either. Explain.

Answer is a list so we create a list out of a list for example this gets evaluated:

(cons '() 1)
(cons '(() . 1)  4)
(cons '((() . 1) . 4)  16)
